## Problems with an API request?

We make every effort to keep this API documentation complete and error-free. If you still have a problem with one of the API requests, please open a ticket in our [support forum](https://forum.seatable.io).

In order to help you quickly, please add the following information in your ticket:

1. **Detailled Description:**
   Please describe what you want to achieve. Do you use SeaTable Cloud or your own system? Name the SeaTable Server version and whether you are using Enterprise or Developer Edition. Please be precise and give as much information as possible to avoid further inquiries.

1. **API request and API response:**
   Please copy the full API request and output into the ticket. Of course, you should remove your credentials and all tokens or replace them with placeholders.

1. **Output of the browser console:**
   You can use `Option` + `⌘` + `J` (on macOS), or `Shift` + `CTRL` + `J` (on Windows/Linux) to open your browser console. There you can typically get more details what is going wrong. Make a screenshot and post it in your new topic as well.

## Expert support

We provide advanced API trainings and support sessions. Please contact us at [support@seatable.io](mailto:support@seatable.io) to schedule a session and to clarify the costs.
